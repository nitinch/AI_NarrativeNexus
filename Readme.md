#  AI Narrative Nexus — Dynamic Text Analysis Platform

##  Overview
AI Narrative Nexus is a dynamic text analysis platform that ingests diverse text (articles, reports, social posts), extracts key themes and sentiment, and turns them into concise summaries and **actionable insights**. The goal is to **save time, enhance decision-making, and drive measurable outcomes**.

---

##  Goals & Objectives
- Accept multiple input formats (.txt, .csv, .docx, etc.)
- Robust preprocessing (cleaning, normalization, tokenization)
- Topic modeling (LDA/NMF) and sentiment analysis
- Summarization (extractive + abstractive)
- **Deliver actionable insights for decision-making.**
- Interactive dashboards and exportable reports

---

##  Methodology (High-Level)
1. **Data Collection & Input Handling**  
   Upload UI with validation for supported file types and sizes.
2. **Preprocessing**  
   Remove noise, normalize text (stemming/lemmatization), tokenize.
3. **Topic Modeling**  
   LDA/NMF to reveal latent themes, tuned via coherence metrics.
4. **Sentiment Analysis**  
   Classify polarity (positive/neutral/negative) per topic/document.
5. **Summarization**  
   - Extractive: key sentence selection  
   - Abstractive: generate concise paraphrases
6. **Visualization & Reporting**  
   Word clouds, sentiment bars, topic distribution, insight reports.

##  Actionable Insights for Decision-Making
Use these outputs to steer priorities and next steps:

- **Impact-Weighted Themes:** Rank topics by frequency × sentiment intensity to spotlight what matters most now.  
- **Early-Warning Signals:** Flag negative-momentum topics (worsening sentiment over recent windows).  
- **Segmented Findings:** Break down by **source, audience, product, region, or time** to uncover targeted interventions.  
- **Root-Cause Pointers:** Surface co-occurring terms within negative topics to suggest likely drivers.  
- **Recommendation Hints:** For each high-impact topic, emit **next-best-actions** (e.g., “clarify policy X”, “ship patch Y”, “launch comms for issue Z”).  
- **Confidence & Coverage:** Attach confidence scores and data coverage stats so stakeholders can gauge reliability.  
- **Closed-Loop Tracking:** Persist topics and show **before/after** sentiment to verify if actions moved the needle.

##  8-Week Roadmap (Milestones)
- **W1:** Data ingestion & upload UI, validation, sample tests  
- **W2:** Preprocessing pipeline (clean, normalize, tokenize)  
- **W3:** Topic modeling (LDA/NMF), coherence tuning  
- **W4:** Sentiment model integration & validation  
- **W5:** Summarization (extractive + abstractive) & insight rules  
- **W6–7:** Dashboards (word clouds, sentiment bars, topic charts), reporting module  
- **W8:** Final evaluation, docs, presentation, and handover
